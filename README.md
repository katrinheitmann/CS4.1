#  Validation: Produce a document outlining all data sets and their validation criteria for all available requirements

Summary -- In particular for the galaxy input catalogs, a set of observations and their biases and selection
effects needs to be assembled for use in validating the simulated catalogs.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS4.1.1 ( 03/16 ): Produce a document outlining all data sets and their validation criteria for all
available requirements.

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.

What are the three primary distributions you need to get correct from the mock catalogs?
